Changes
=======
v2.10.10
- Fix concurrency issue leading to a crash

v2.10.9
- Improve handling of service discovery messages with entries
  referencing too many options.
- Prevent sending of duplicate remote subscriptions to local clients
  if the local client processes incoming subscriptions too slow.
- Remote (un)subscriptions to the same eventgroup are now queued in
  the routing manager until the local client has processed the
  previous (un)subscription for this eventgroup.
- Introduce new json configuration parameter 'diagnosis_mask' to
  control the number of bits in the client ID used for the diagnosis
  address. This can be used to enable more than 254 concurrent clients
  on a node. For more information see the vsomeipUserGuide.
- If the service discovery is enabled it is is only started if a
  matching multicast route for the configured service discovery
  multicast group is present in the system. This applies only to
  Linux.
- Rework security configuration:
    - Allow policy specifications without client specification.
    - Allow policies to be specified for ranges of uids/gids.
  For more information see the vsomeipUserGuide.

v2.10.8
- Change dispatching of availability states in case an availability
  handler of a service instance is blocked in user code: Availability
  states of a service instance are now never dispatched parallel. The
  next availability state for a service instance is only dispatched
  after the blocked availability handler returned from user code. If
  the availability of the service instance changes in the meantime,
  subsequent incoming messages of the service instance are queued
  until the availability change was reported to the user code.
- Subscriptions to remotely offered services are now always done based
  on the protocol(s) the remote service is offered with. The
  subscription_type parameter of the application::subscribe method is
  ignored.
- Added wildcard support ("any") for the uid and gid json parameters
  in the security configuration.
- Fix possible deadlock on application shutdown

v2.10.7
- Fix potential deadlock when expiring remote subscriptions
- Rework restarting of tcp client endpoints to prevent heap corruption
  under high load situations

v2.10.6
- Fix concurrency issue leading to a crash when asynchronous
  subscription handlers were used.
- Improved packing of subscriptions sent out as answer to incoming
  offer service messages.

v2.10.5
- Fix possible deadlock on application shutdown
- Try to reestablish TCP connection on resubscription if the remote
  closed the connection
- Introduce new configuration file parameters to control
  interpretation of TTL field of incoming remote offers and
  subscriptions:
  - service-discovery > ttl_factor_offers (optional array of
    service/instance/TTL factor tuples)
  - service-discovery > ttl_factor_subscriptions (optional array of
    service/instance/TTL factor tuples)
- Added possibility to debounce external events/fields
  based on time or change of data in the payload (maskable) via new
  configuration file parameter:
  - debounce (optional array)
  For more information see the vsomeipUserGuide.
- Added possibility to limit amount of memory used to cache outgoing
  messages on IP port basis or globally via configuration file
  parameter:
  - endpoint-queue-limits (array): to limit on IP:Port (endpoint)
    level
  - endpoint-queue-limit-external: to generally limit all external
    endpoints.
  - endpoint-queue-limit-local: to limit queue sizes for local
    communication
  For more information see the vsomeipUserGuide.

  situations.

v2.10.2
- Fix deadlock in routing manager when processing subscription
  acknowledgment from a local client if the corresponding service
  instance was stopped in the meanwhile.

  the application interface: Registered handlers will only be called

  hosts the routing manager.

- The service discovery now debounces newly offered service instances to avoid
  sending out the offers of the same service instance with a too high frequency.
  The default debounce time is set to 500ms. It can be changed via the new json
  file parameter service-discovery/offer_debounce_time.
