# Precision Time Protocol

The Precision time protocol is used to keep the computer and other devices'
clocks synchronized and accurate. The PTP is capable of submicrosecond accuracy
which improves the accuracy given by Network Time Protocol (NTP).
PTP is divided between kernal and user land.

The standard IEEE 1588 specifies an ethernet type for this protocol
encapsulation: `0x88f7`. This means that the ether type in the ethernet
protocol will be `0x88f7`.


To capture the PTP messages in a linux client use the next comand:

```
tcpdump -i <ether_ifae> ether proto 0x88f7 
```

## Introduction to PTP

The clocks managed by PTP follow a master-slave hierarchy. The slaves are synch
to their masters clock. The hierarchy is updated by the _best master clock_
algorithm running on every clock. The clock with only one port can be master or
slave and is called _boundary clock (BC)_. The top-level master is called
grand master clk which can be synchronized with a GPS. This way disparate
networks can be synchronized.

The HW support is the main advantage of PTP. It's supported by the next NICs
and switches (at least)

The package `linuxptp` includes `ptp4l` and `phc2sys`. `ptp4l` implements the
PTP boundary clock and ordinary clock. When HW time stamping is enabled, `ptp4l`
synchronizes the PTP HW clock to the master clock. With SW time stamping, syncs
with the master clock. `phc2sys` is needed only with HW time stamping to sync
the system clock to the PTP HW clk ot the NIC.

### Find if the iface supports PTP

```bash
udev info /sys/class/net/eth0
```

Go to the real dir:

```bash
cd `realpath /sys/class/net/eth0`

```


PTP supports two multicast destination addresses:
- `01:1b:19:00:00:00`: General group address
    - An 802.1Q VLAN bridge would __forward__ the frame unchanged
- `01:80:c2:00:00:0e`: Individual LAN scope group address
    - An 802.1Q VLAN bridge wound __drop__ the frame

### Transparent clock

### Boundary clock


### End-to-end

This mechanism uses a message exchange (delay,request,response) method between slave and master.
The slave sends a delay request message to the master, which responds with a delay response message
back to the requesting slave. The propagation path between the two endpoints might not be PTP-aware
switches/hubs/routers etc


### Peer-to-peer

This mechanisms uses a port-base peer delay message. Each port on a PTP devies sends peer delay request messages to the port it is directly connected to. The connected port then responds with a peer delay response message. The reuqesting port finally stores the propagation delay measured between the 2 ports. All ports in a PTP aware metwork must use the same delay mechanism. This implies taht only complete PTP aware networks must use the same delay mechanism. Furthermore, PÂ§P is often mentioned when the capability of a PTP transparent clock devide is specified since such devices are required in a switched / routed network using P2P mechanism.

The final calculation of the propagation delay between master and slave is done by each transparent clokc by adding the receiving port peer delay and the residence time of the packet in the device to the correction field of the PTP event message, for instance a synchronization message. In this way sudden changes in the propagation path have a very small impact on the synchronization of slaves.


### **End-to-End** vs **Peer-to-Peer**
[src](https://blog.meinbergglobal.com/2013/09/19/end-end-versus-peer-peer/)


This two are two types of propagation delay measurement mechanisms used in 
IEEE 1588.
Peer-to-peer should be preferred, but every node in the network needs to be
1588 capable, i.e. they are either transparent or boundary clocks. Otherwise
end-to-end should be used.
